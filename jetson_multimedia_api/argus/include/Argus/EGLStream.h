    /**
     * Sets the mode of the OutputStream. Available options are:
     *
     *   MAILBOX:
     *     In this mode, only the newest frame is made available to the consumer. When Argus
     *     completes a frame it empties the mailbox and inserts the new frame into the mailbox.
     *     The consumer then retrieves the frame from the mailbox and processes it; when
     *     finished, the frame is either placed back into the mailbox (if the mailbox is empty)
     *     or discarded (if the mailbox is not empty). This mode implies 2 things:
     *
     *       - If the consumer consumes frames slower than Argus produces frames, then some
     *         frames may be lost (never seen by the consumer).
     *
     *       - If the consumer consumes frames faster than Argus produces frames, then the
     *         consumer may see some frames more than once.
     *
     *   FIFO:
     *     When using this mode, every producer frame is made available to the consumer through
     *     the use of a fifo queue for the frames. When using this mode, the fifo queue length
     *     must be specified using setFifoLength. When Argus completes a frame it inserts it to
     *     the head of the fifo queue. If the fifo is full (already contains the number of frames
     *     equal to the fifo queue length), Argus will stall until the fifo is no longer
     *     full. The consumer consumes frames from the tail of the queue; however, if the
     *     consumer releases a frame while the queue is empty, the frame is set aside and will
     *     be returned again the next time the consumer requests a frame if another new frame
     *     has not been inserted into the fifo queue before then. Once a new frame is inserted
     *     into the fifo queue, any previously released frame will be permanently discarded.
     *     This mode implies:
     *
     *       - Frames are never discarded until the consumer has processed them.
     *
     *       - If the consumer consumes frames slower than Argus produces them, Argus will stall.
     *
     *       - If the consumer consumes frames faster than Argus produces them, then the
     *         consumer may see some frames more than once.
