/**
 * @class IBayerSharpnessMap
 *
 * Interface to Bayer sharpness map metadata.
 *
 * The Bayer sharpness map exposes image sharpness metrics that can be used in order
 * to help determine the correct position of the lens to achieve the best focus.
 * Each metric is a normalized floating-point value representing the estimated sharpness
 * for a particular color channel and pixel region, called bins, where 0.0 and 1.0 map to
 * the minimum and maximum possible sharpness values, respectively. Sharpness values
 * generally correlate with image focus in that a low sharpness implies a poorly focused
 * (blurry) region while a high sharpness implies a well focused (sharp) region.
 *
 * The size and layout of the bins used to calculate the sharpness metrics are determined
 * by the libargus implementation, and are illustrated in the following diagram. The bin size
 * and interval are constant across the image, and are positioned such that the generated
 * metrics cover the majority of the full image. All dimensions are given in pixels.
