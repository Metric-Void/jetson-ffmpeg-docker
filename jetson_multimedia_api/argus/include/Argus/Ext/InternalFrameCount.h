/**
 * Adds accessors for an internal frame count performance metric.
 * The "internal frame count" is an implementation-dependent metric that may be
 * used to detect performance issues and producer frame drops for libargus
 * implementations that make use of internal captures.
 *
 * When a device is opened by a CaptureSession, the libargus implementation may
 * begin to immediately capture and process frames from the device in order to
 * initialize the camera subsystem even before a client request has been
 * submitted. Similarly, frames may be captured and processed by the
 * implementation when the client is idle or not ready for output in order to
 * maintain the driver subsystem and/or auto-control state (exposure, white
 * balance, etc). These captures are started and processed entirely within the
 * libargus implementation, with no inputs from or outputs to the client
 * application, and so are referred to as "internal" captures. These internal
 * captures are typically submitted when there are no client requests in the
 * capture queue or no stream buffers available for output within a sensor
 * frame period, and so knowing when an internal capture has been submitted can
 * be used to detect application or performance issues in cases where these
 * conditions are not expected to occur. This extension provides this
 * information in the form of an "internal frame count", which is the total
 * number of captures submitted by the session including both the internal
 * captures as well as client-submitted requests. If an internal frame count
 * gap appears between two client-submitted captures, this means that one or
 * more internal captures have been performed.
 *
 * When an application is saturating the capture queue to maintain driver
 * efficiency, either manually or by using repeat capture requests, the
 * internal frame count can be used to detect when internal captures are
 * submitted due to a lack of available output stream buffers. This situation
 * leads to sensor frames that are not output to the client's output stream,
 * which is usually an undesirable behavior that is referred to as "producer
 * frame drop". This is generally caused by a high consumer processing time,
 * which starves the streamâ€™s available buffer pool, and can often be resolved
 * by decreasing the consumer processing time (reducing the time a buffer is
 * acquired, decreasing system load, increasing hardware clocks, etc.)
